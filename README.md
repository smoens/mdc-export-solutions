# Microsoft Defender for Cloud - Export Solutions

**Get your security findings out of the portal and into places where they become actionable.**

## Why export Defender for Cloud data?

Microsoft Defender for Cloud continuously evaluates your Azure resources against security recommendations, vulnerability scans, and compliance benchmarks. That data is powerful - but only if you can use it beyond the portal.

- **See everything at once** - Query findings across all subscriptions in a single view instead of clicking through one subscription at a time
- **Track trends over time** - Build a historical record to answer "are we getting healthier?" and produce compliance reports with actual trend lines
- **Build custom dashboards** - Power BI, Grafana, or any BI tool connected to SQL - tailored for CISOs, platform teams, or app owners
- **Automate responses** - Trigger workflows when posture changes - create tickets, send alerts, feed into SIEM/SOAR
- **Own your data** - Control retention, indexing, and query performance at predictable cost instead of depending on Log Analytics limits

## Choose your approach

| | [Event Hub SQL Pipeline](solutions/eventhub-sql-pipeline/) | [Resource Graph Export](solutions/resource-graph-export/) |
|---|---|---|
| **Pattern** | Continuous streaming | Point-in-time snapshot |
| **Data flow** | Defender → Event Hub → Stream Analytics → SQL | Resource Graph → PowerShell → CSV |
| **Infrastructure** | Event Hub, SQL, Stream Analytics, Elastic Jobs | None - just run a script |
| **Best for** | Dashboards, trend analysis, automated workflows | Ad-hoc reporting, quick audits, Power BI |
| **Update frequency** | Real-time + weekly snapshots | On-demand |
| **Multi-subscription** | Per-subscription CE setup (automate via [Azure Policy](docs/concepts/Azure-Policy-Continuous-Export.md)) | Single query across all subscriptions |

## Quick start

### Option A - Streaming pipeline (Terraform + bootstrap)

```bash
# 1. Deploy infrastructure
cd .infra/sql/
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # edit with your values
terraform init && terraform apply

# 2. Run bootstrap (schema + permissions + Elastic Job schedule)
cd ../../solutions/eventhub-sql-pipeline/bootstrap/scripts/
./Initialize-Bootstrap.ps1 `
    -SqlServerFqdn          "$(terraform -chdir=../../.infra/sql output -raw sql_server_fqdn)" `
    -ElasticJobUmiName      "$(terraform -chdir=../../.infra/sql output -raw elastic_job_umi_name)" `
    -ElasticJobUmiClientId  "$(terraform -chdir=../../.infra/sql output -raw elastic_job_umi_client_id)" `
    -AsaAssessmentsPrincipalName    "asa-defender-assessments" `
    -AsaSubAssessmentsPrincipalName "asa-defender-subassessments" `
    -SkipDatabaseCreation -SkipMasterUser
```

### Option B - Point-in-time export (zero infrastructure)

```powershell
cd solutions/resource-graph-export/
./Export-ArgFindings.ps1
```

| [Continuous Export](docs/concepts/Continuous-Export.md) | Streams Defender findings to Event Hub or Log Analytics in near-real-time |
| [Event Hub](docs/concepts/Event-Hub.md) | Buffers streaming events with partitioning and consumer groups |
| [Stream Analytics](docs/concepts/Stream-Analytics.md) | Processes events in real time using SQL-like queries |
| [Azure SQL Database](docs/concepts/Azure-SQL-Database.md) | Stores deduplicated findings in typed tables |
| [Azure Policy (Continuous Export)](docs/concepts/Azure-Policy-Continuous-Export.md) | Deploys Continuous Export at scale across subscriptions using built-in policy |
| [Azure Resource Graph](docs/concepts/Azure-Resource-Graph.md) | Cross-subscription KQL queries - zero infrastructure required |

## Security

All solutions follow these principles:

- **Entra ID only** - no SQL auth, no SAS keys, no hardcoded credentials
- **Managed Identity** for all service-to-service authentication
- **Least-privilege RBAC** - specific permissions, not broad roles
- **TLS 1.2 minimum** on all services
