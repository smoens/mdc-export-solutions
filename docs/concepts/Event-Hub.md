# Event Hub

**Azure Event Hubs** is a big-data streaming platform and event ingestion service. It acts as the "front door" for an event pipeline, decoupling event producers from consumers.

## Why it matters

In the Defender for Cloud export pipeline, Event Hub is the buffer between Continuous Export and Stream Analytics. It provides:

- **Decoupling** - Defender writes events independently of how fast (or slow) the consumer processes them.
- **Partitioning** - events are distributed across partitions for parallel processing.
- **Durability** - events are retained for a configurable period (1-90 days), so consumers can replay if needed.
- **Multiple consumers** - different consumer groups can read the same stream independently.

## Key details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Service** | Azure Event Hubs |
| **Protocol** | AMQP 1.0, HTTPS, Kafka |
| **Partitions** | 2-32 per hub (streaming pipeline uses 2) |
| **Retention** | 1–90 days (Basic/Standard), up to unlimited (Premium/Dedicated) |
| **Throughput** | 1 MB/s in, 2 MB/s out per throughput unit (Standard tier) |
| **Authentication** | Entra ID (managed identity), SAS - this repo uses Entra ID only |
| **Pricing tier used** | Basic (~$11/month) |

## Role in the streaming pipeline

The streaming SQL pipeline deploys **two Event Hubs** inside a single namespace:

| Hub | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `assessments` | Receives security assessment findings |
| `subassessments` | Receives sub-assessment (vulnerability) findings |

Continuous Export publishes to these hubs. Stream Analytics reads from them using dedicated consumer groups.
